		<p>This application is a simple universal app built with React Router and Express.js.</p>
		<p>Although the performance of the front-end driven website is incredible—faster, less CPU and memory usage—the one of the biggest concerns is the SEO. In usual way, the search engines don’t recognize the content that is dynamically generated on the client side, and this fact causes that however remarkable content you provide to users, your app just return the blank page to the search engines. This isn’t right. To be your app indexed by Google, you also have to render the content on the server-side just for the robots.</p>
		<p>A <em>Universal App</em> is a application that is a single-page application, yet also renders the content on the server side. Good for users, good robots.</p>
